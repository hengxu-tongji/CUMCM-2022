# Bearing-Only Passive Localization for UAV Formation Flight

This project contains the code and the final submitted paper for our entry in the 2022 Contemporary Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling (CUMCM) B problem. We were awarded the third prize in the competition.

**Project Overview:** This project investigates the problem of drone swarm formation flight using passive bearing-only localization to achieve drone positioning and position adjustment. The study focuses on the scenario of a circular formation where a central drone collaborates to locate or adjust the positions of other drones, and further extends to position adjustment strategies for other formation shapes such as rhombus and cone.
