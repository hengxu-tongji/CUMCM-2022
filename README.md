## Bearing-Only Passive Localization for UAV Formation Flight

This project contains the code and the final submitted paper for our entry in the 2022 Contemporary Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling (CUMCM) B problem. We were awarded the third prize in the competition.

**Project Overview:** This project explores the application of bearing-only passive localization techniques for achieving precise positioning and coordinated adjustments within Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) formations during flight. Our primary focus involves analyzing scenarios within a circular formation, where a central UAV assists in localizing or adjusting the positions of other UAVs. Furthermore, we extend our investigation to encompass position adjustment strategies for alternative formation geometries, notably rhombus and cone configurations.
